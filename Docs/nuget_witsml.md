## Access pre-built Witsml nuget package

If you only need to include the [Witsml](https://github.com/equinor/witsml-explorer/tree/main/Src/Witsml) project (`witsml-explorer/Src/Witsml`),
then you can simply add a pre-published nuget package for that library:
`dotnet add PROJECT package WitsmlClient`
